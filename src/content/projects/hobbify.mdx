**Hobbify** is a mobile app designed to bring hobby enthusiasts together by making it easy to create and join local events based on shared interests. Whether it's hiking, gaming, photography, or pottery. Hobbify helps users find like-minded people nearby and connect in real life.

It was developed collaboratively in a small team as part of a university project, where we aimed to solve the problem of social connection around shared hobbies. Built with React Native and Firebase, Hobbify offers a smooth cross-platform experience to help users grow their communities through hobby-based events.

## ðŸ“š Motivation

During university, I realized how difficult it can be to make new friends who share the same hobbies, especially in a big city where everyone's on different schedules. I wanted to create a platform that could break that barrier by encouraging real-world meetups around things people genuinely enjoy.

**Hobbify** was born out of the idea to help people stop scrolling and start doing. Whether you want to find a running buddy, start a weekend sketch group, or just meet others who love playing board games, Hobbify helps make that happen.
