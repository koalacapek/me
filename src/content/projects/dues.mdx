## ðŸ“š Motivation

As a UNSW student, I often found myself juggling multiple courses, each with its own set of assignments, quizzes, and project deadlines. Like many students, I relied heavily on Moodle, course outlines, and scattered calendar entries to keep track â€” which became overwhelming fast.
What made it more difficult was how each course had different formats for delivering important dates: some used PDFs, others buried them in announcements. There was no centralized system for students to track everything at a glance. I realized this was a problem not just for me, but for many of my peers.

That's when I decided to build Dues â€” a tool that would serve as a single source of truth for all upcoming deadlines. The goal wasn't just to create a calendar app, but something built for students, with real reminders, calendar syncing, and even a PDF parser to pull deadlines directly from course outlines.
Ultimately, I wanted to build something that I personally needed â€” a practical, helpful tool that reduced mental clutter and made academic life a bit more manageable.

## ðŸš€ What Can Be Improved

While **Dues** is working just fine, there are several areas of improvement for it:

- **User Authentication**  
  Currently, there are no authentication except for Google, which means users need to manually add courses every time they visit Dues. Integrating proper authentication would make it more secure and personalized.

- **Collaboration Features**  
  Supporting group projects or shared calendars between classmates would be a great addition. This could include task assignment, shared reminders, or synced group deadlines.

- **Better PDF Parsing**  
  The current PDF deadline extractor works for a certain template of course outline by analyzing patterns. Improvements could include more robust natural language processing (NLP) to better understand academic phrasing across different course outlines.

- **Mobile Experience**  
  While the app is responsive, building a dedicated mobile version or a progressive web app (PWA) could provide offline access and push notifications.

- **Analytics & Insights**  
  Adding usage stats or visual summaries (e.g., weekly workload charts) could help students manage their time more effectively.

- **UNSW Integration**  
  Ideally, Dues could connect directly with UNSW systems (Moodle, course APIs) to automate syncing of deadlines without manual uploads. Collaborating with UNSW to gain data will be hugely beneficial for Dues.
