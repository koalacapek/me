## Motivation

Indonesia's stock exchange (IDX) makes foreign flow data publicly available, but it's often raw, fragmented, and difficult to interpret effectively. This is a missed opportunity, especially considering that the Indonesian stock market is significantly influenced by foreign investors, with their activity often driving both short-term volatility and long-term trends.
I built this tool to bridge that gap â€” turning tabular data into intuitive, visual insights.

The goal was to make foreign investment behavior more accessible and actionable for retail traders, students, and analysts alike.
By showing which stocks are being accumulated or sold by foreign investors over time, users can quickly identify patterns, monitor sentiment shifts, and make better-informed decisions backed by data.

## Learnings

- Creating reusable React + Tailwind components for consistent UI
- Handling dynamic data filtering and real-time state updates
- Building RESTful APIs using Django and serving them to a Next.js frontend
- Applying real-world charting patterns to financial data

## What can be improved

- **Real-Time Data Feed**  
  Current data is static or uploaded manually. Integration with a real-time IDX API would enable live market tracking.

- **Historical Comparisons**  
  The dashboard currently compares recent data. Adding year-over-year or quarter-based performance comparisons would increase value.

- **Mobile Responsiveness**  
  The app is built for desktop. A responsive or mobile-optimized version would expand accessibility.

- **User Preferences & Watchlist**  
  Allowing users to save specific stocks or default filters would improve user experience.

- **Advanced Filters & Sorting**  
  Adding filtering by sector, market cap, or custom ranges would offer deeper analysis tools.
