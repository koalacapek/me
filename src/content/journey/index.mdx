Hey there! 👋🏻
My name is Hans Kristian Reynaldi. I'm a Computer Science graduate from the University of New South Wales (UNSW).

My journey into the world of software engineering really kicked off in an unexpected way. Back in high school, I had no idea what I wanted to pursue at university. However, I was always the “tech guy” in the family — the one who loved technology and the internet.

Like many kids my age, I spent a lot of time gaming. One day, my dad suggested, "Why not try Computer Science after high school?" Since I was always into tech, that idea intrigued me. How do people build things from nothing?
How do these computing technologies shape the systems we rely on at such a massive scale?

Fast forward to today — I've graduated with a degree in Computer Science, and I truly enjoyed most of the courses, especially the one on Front-End Development.
